# AI-Powered Product Search Web Application

This is a modern, responsive web application that provides an intuitive interface for searching products using natural language queries. The application is built with HTML5, JavaScript, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, and Fluent UI components, and connects to the Data API Builder to query an Azure SQL database.

All the content in the WebApp folder have been generated by GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4, based on the requirements of the Azure SQL Modernize App with AI sample.

- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Fluent UI Web Components**: Microsoft's design system components
- **Data API Builder**: RESTful API for Azure SQL database access

## Prerequisites

1. **Data API Builder**: Ensure the Data API Builder is running on `localhost:5000`
2. **Azure SQL Database**: With the product search stored procedure configured
3. **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

## Getting Started

1. **Start the Data API Builder**:

   ```bash
   cd ../DAB
   dab start
   ```

2. **Open the Application**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser, or
   - Serve it through a local web server for better development experience:
  
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js http-server
   npx http-server
   
   # Using Live Server in VS Code
   # Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

3. **Start Searching**:
   - Enter natural language queries in the search box
   - Optionally specify a category filter
   - View AI-powered product recommendations with insights

## File Structure

```text
WebApp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file with UI layout
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js              # JavaScript application logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## API Integration

The application connects to the Data API Builder endpoint:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000/api/searchProducts`
- **Method**: POST
- **Payload**:
 
  ```json
  {
    "searchTerm": "find the best video game to gift to a teenager boy",
    "category": ""
  }
  ```

## Configuration

You can modify the API settings in `app.js`:

```javascript
const API_CONFIG = {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:5000/api',
    endpoints: {
        searchProducts: '/searchProducts'
    }
};
```

## Search Examples

Try these natural language queries:

- "find the best video game to gift to a teenager boy"
- "educational toys for kids"
- "outdoor sports equipment"
- "electronics for home office"
- "books for learning programming"

## UI Components

The application uses several Fluent UI Web Components:

- **fluent-text-field**: For search input and category filter
- **fluent-button**: For search and action buttons
- **fluent-accordion**: For expandable product descriptions

## Styling

The design features:

- **Glass Morphism Effect**: Translucent search container with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Modern gradient color schemes
- **Card-based Layout**: Product results displayed in clean, hoverable cards
- **Responsive Grid**: Adaptive layout that works on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and hover transitions

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Connection Errors**: Clear messaging when the API is unavailable
- **No Results**: Helpful messaging and suggestions for new searches
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during search operations
- **Input Validation**: Ensures meaningful search terms are provided

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## Performance Considerations

- **Debounced Search**: Real-time search is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and heavy content are loaded on demand
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Lightweight external libraries for fast loading
- **CSS Animations**: Hardware-accelerated transitions for smooth performance

## Development

To modify or extend the application:

1. **Add New Features**: Extend the JavaScript functions in `app.js`
2. **Update Styling**: Modify Tailwind classes or add custom CSS
3. **Change API Endpoints**: Update the `API_CONFIG` object
4. **Add Components**: Include additional Fluent UI components as needed

## Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **API Not Found (404)**:
   - Ensure Data API Builder is running on localhost:5000
   - Check the DAB configuration in `../DAB/dab-config.json`

2. **CORS Issues**:
   - Verify CORS settings in the DAB configuration
   - Ensure `"origins": ["*"]` is set for development

3. **No Search Results**:
   - Check that the Azure SQL database is connected
   - Verify the stored procedure `dbo.search_products` exists
   - Test the API directly using the `test.http` file
